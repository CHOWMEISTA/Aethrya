# 1. The World of Aethyra

Aethyra is a high‑fantasy world suspended between divine design and mortal defiance. Once orderly and predictable, it is now fractured—geographically, politically, and metaphysically.

Floating ruins drift across the skies. Forests migrate over decades. Seas glow faintly with broken ley‑energy. Entire bloodlines are touched by strange destiny.

Above all, the night sky bears a permanent scar: a shattered constellation known as **The Crownfall**.

Beneath the surface, rivers of slow magic—old ley currents—curl like sleeping snakes. These currents feed cities, empower relics, and whisper to the attuned. The Crownfall left wounds in those currents; some veins pulse unpredictably, pouring raw possibility into certain regions and warping both men and land.

# 2. The Three Primal Forces

All existence flows from three cosmic principles:

- **Vyre** – Creation, structure, memory, law  
- **Khar** – Entropy, destruction, mutation, hunger  
- **Solune** – Will, consciousness, fate, choice

These forces existed before the gods. They are not moral in themselves; they are tendencies the cosmos leans toward. When they clash, reality flexes—mountains rise, minds shift, species change.

Mortals interpret these forces as elements of philosophy or faith; scholars argue over whether they are metaphysical laws, emergent properties of the cosmos, or living minds sleeping at the edges of reality.

# 3. The Astral Regents (Pantheon)

The Astral Regents were god‑like architects of reality, created to stabilize the primal forces. Each Regent embodied an aspect of cosmic order and was given dominion to shepherd that domain.

| Regent | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| Aurelion | Order, stars, time |
| Thalos | War, storms, strength |
| Myrr | Death, passage, memory |
| Serathiel | Knowledge, secrets |
| Vaelor | Nature, growth |
| Kaelis | Light, justice |
| Noxara | Darkness, dreams |
| Ioxara | Will, fate, freedom |

The Regents were not simply distant deities; they reshaped continents, cultivated species, and set the first laws of magic. Temples rose where their influence was strong and whole civilizations grew under their guidance.

Ioxara was the youngest—and the most dangerous. Where other Regents prized order or balance, Ioxara prized agency. She taught mortals to hear the threads of destiny and to pull them. Her lessons promised freedom, and for some, they delivered godlike possibility.

# 4. The Accord of Stars

The Regents bound themselves by an ancient contract:

> No Regent shall alter mortal destiny directly.

This agreement stabilized reality for over 8,000 years. It created a delicate lattice: the Regents could shape the world but not seize the will of individuals. It forced the gods to guide and inspire rather than decree.

Under the Accord, magic had rules; prophecy had limits; and the line between fate and choice was respected. Scholars and clerics kept archives of the Accord’s wording, and some orders rose to enforce it.

# 5. The Shattering of Ioxara

Ioxara concluded that the Accord was slavery disguised as protection. Over centuries she grew restless, testing small changes that nudged outcomes rather than dictating them. Mortals who heeded her whispers found themselves capable of improbable choices.

When she pushed further—attempting to give mortals true control over fate—the other Regents balked. A metaphysical war was impossible without destroying the fabric they tended; the Regents could not bring themselves to annihilate one of their own.

So they shattered her essence instead—splintering Ioxara into fragments cast across reality. Each fragment retained a spark of her power and will.

# 6. The Crownfall Cataclysm

When Ioxara broke:

- Ley lines ruptured
- Continents cracked
- Entire cities vanished
- New monsters formed
- The sky fractured

The physical and mystical consequences were immediate and long‑lasting: storms that bent time, forests that remembered the dead, and storms of glass that fell like teeth from the rent heavens. The Regents vanished soon after—some were slain, some withdrew into unrevealed sanctums, others faded into myth.

The Cataclysm’s echoes are still felt: regions where time runs thin, where crops grow and rot overnight, or where children are born speaking languages no living person remembers.

# 7. The Willshards

Fragments of Ioxara crystallized into metaphysical artifacts called **Willshards**. They are neither fully divine nor merely magical; each shard is a sliver of sentient intent.

They embed into:

- Mountains (shard‑stone peaks that bend gravity)  
- Weapons (blades that insist on destiny)  
- Bloodlines (families where small miracles repeat)  
- Living minds (hosts who dream in prophecy)

They grant:

- Reality manipulation at short range  
- Immense magical power  
- The ability to alter or foresee tenuous threads of fate

They cost:

- Sanity (voices and competing wills)  
- Stability (corruption of the body or mind)  
- Fate itself (using a shard can borrow or erase a sliver of one’s future)

Willshards are sought by scholars, feared by rulers, and worshiped by cultists. Their presence creates communities of influence—settlements that prosper unnaturally or decline into obsession and ruin.

# 8. The Ages of History

### Age of Genesis
Creation of Aethyra; the initial shaping by primordial forces.

### Age of Accord
Rule of the Regents; civilization flourishes beneath their oversight.

### Age of Shattering
The Crownfall; the Accord breaks and the world is rent.

### Age of Ash
Collapse of civilization; survivors cling to knowledge and salvage technologies.

### Modern Age
Fragmented nations rebuild atop divine ruins; new powers rise to fill the void.

# 9. The Nations of the Modern World

No single empire rules the world. Instead, power is divided among rival civilizations—each finding ways to harness or avoid shard influence. Trade is vital, and espionage is deadly. The largest among them is the Commonwealth, a state that balances technomagic, bureaucracy, and secret violence.

# 10. The Commonwealth of Cromwell

**Full Name:** The Grand Commonwealth of Unified Provinces  
**Capital:** Cromwell  
**Population:** 18–25 million  
**Government:** Federal Magocratic Republic  
**Motto:** *From Many, One Will*

## Overview

The Commonwealth is the world’s largest nation by population, economy, and military power. It grew by absorbing fractured kingdoms after the Crownfall, promising stability and protection in exchange for local autonomy and tribute.

Its prosperity comes at a price: a vast bureaucracy, guild influence, and the quiet suppression of inconvenient truths. The Commonwealth is orderly, prosperous, and deeply corrupt.

## The Capital: Cromwell

A megacity built around the **Grand Ley Spire**, a pre‑cataclysmic structure that acts as a regulator and amplifier for surrounding ley currents. The Spire’s presence made Cromwell a hub for arcanists, engineers, and politicians.

Population: 3–4 million. Districts:

- **High Crom** – Government, embassies  
- **The Spires** – Mage academies and research towers  
- **Blackharbor** – Trade port & teleport gates  
- **Gutterward** – Undercity, criminal districts, and refugee warrens  
- **Crownfall Plaza** – Impact site of a sky‑fragment, now a field of shifting stone and rumor

## Government Structure

### The Tri‑Council

1. Civic Chancellor – Law & economy  
2. High Arcanor – Magic regulation  
3. Marshal Protector – Military command

The Tri‑Council rules with legislation, arcane decree, and force when necessary. Beneath them, corporations, guilds, and the Church of the Regents jockey for influence.

## Military

- Commonwealth Legions — disciplined infantry and siege corps  
- Arcanist Corps — battlefield mages and ward engineers  
- Skyfleet — floating warships that patrol ley‑sea lanes  
- The Black Ledger — intelligence service specializing in shard surveillance and political manipulation

## Policy on Willshards

Officially illegal; in practice, the Commonwealth quarantines, studies, and occasionally weaponizes shards. Vaults under Cromwell hold shards in sealed reliquaries, guarded by oaths and enchantments. Rumors say the Tri‑Council uses shards to steer elections and erase rebellions.

# 11. Other Major Nations

## Radiant Concord
A theocratic empire that enforces divine law and leads the largest anti‑shard crusades. Its templars burn or sanctify sites touched by shards.

## Ashveil Compact
A network of mage‑industrial city‑states where shard technology is refined into engines and wartech. Its workshops produce constructs and eldritch devices.

## Verdant Covenant
A coalition of living forests, druidic circles, and beastfolk who reject centralized civilization. They steward shard‑touched groves and wage guerilla actions to protect wild places.

## Obsidian Sultanates
Desert trade empires that control the caravan routes across the glass‑fields formed by falling crown fragments. Their merchants move rare shard metals.

## Frostbound Holds
Ancient dwarf kingdoms in glacial ranges, expert in stone‑craft and shard‑forging. Their guildsmiths can bind small fragments into runic rings.

# 12. Magic in Aethyra

Three primary traditions dominate the world:

1. Leyward Magic – Draws on the stable currents; predictable, safe, but diminishing where ruptures deepen.  
2. Shardbound Magic – Taps shards directly; potent but corrosive, often rewriting small threads of fate.  
3. True Will – A rare and dangerous practice rumored to let a mortal act with the authority of a Regent; its use risks attracting other shards and the attention of whatever remains of Ioxara.

Magic is regulated unevenly: some cities embrace experimentation, others outlaw arcana entirely.

# 13. Religions and Philosophies

- Church of the Regents — Institutional faith that venerates the surviving Regents and maintains the Accord’s memory.  
- Shard Cultists — Secretive sects venerating Willshards as living saints or demons.  
- The Free Will Doctrine — Philosophers and underground preachers who argue that mortals must reclaim destiny from the gods.  
- Natural Restorationists — Druids and folk who seek to heal the land and erase shard corrosion.

# 14. Races of Aethyra

- Humans  
- Elves (Echoelves) — long‑lived, often attuned to memories of the Accord  
- Dwarves — masters of stone and runes  
- Orcs — tribal societies reshaped by shard contact  
- Shardborn — individuals whose blood carries faint shard influences  
- Skyforged — constructs given sentience by shards or arcane smithing  
- Rootkin — plantfolk tied to living forests  
- Beastfolk — anthropoid animals with culture and clans

# 15. Factions and Secret Orders

- The Veiled Choir — Mystics seeking to gather shards and reconstitute Ioxara (or to free her depending on the cell).  
- The Black Ledger — Commonwealth spies and shard monitors.  
- The Shardbound Circle — Researchers and war‑engineers who embrace shard technology.  
- Concord Inquisition — Theocracy’s arm against heresy and shard worship.  
- Verdant Wardens — Guardians of the wild and keepers of shard‑healed groves.

# 16. Technology and Warfare

Magic‑powered firearms, floating ships, and constructs march alongside siege engines and rune‑forged armor. The mixing of shardcraft and industry produced new weapons—some stable, some wildly unpredictable.

# 17. Cosmology and Planes

- Material Plane (Aethyra) — Home of mortals.  
- Astral Sea (Regents’ realm) — Where the Regents once convened; now torn and difficult to navigate.  
- Shardfall — Broken reality zones where shards spill raw possibility.  
- The Hollow Fate — A prison‑plane that once contained part of Ioxara’s mind.  
- The Entropic Deep — A realm where Khar dominates and decay accelerates.

# 18. Campaign Themes

- Free will vs destiny  
- Corruption of power  
- Gods vs mortals  
- Political manipulation  
- Identity and choice

# 19. Major Story Arcs

1. Discovery of a living Willshard  
2. Civil war within the Commonwealth  
3. Return of a Regent  
4. Reassembly of Ioxara  
5. Collapse or rebirth of fate itself
