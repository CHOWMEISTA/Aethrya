# 1. The World of Aethyra

Aethyra is a high‑fantasy world suspended between divine design and mortal defiance. Once orderly and predictable, it is now fractured—geographically, politically, and metaphysically.

Floating ruins drift across the skies. Forests migrate over decades. Seas glow faintly with broken ley‑energy. Entire bloodlines are touched by strange destiny.

Above all, the night sky bears a permanent scar: a shattered constellation known as **The Crownfall**.

---

# 2. The Three Primal Forces

All existence flows from three cosmic principles:

- **Vyre** – Creation, structure, memory, law  
- **Khar** – Entropy, destruction, mutation, hunger  
- **Solune** – Will, consciousness, fate, choice

These forces existed before the gods.

The gods merely learned to shape them.

---

# 3. The Astral Regents (Pantheon)

The Astral Regents were god‑like architects of reality, created to stabilize the primal forces.

| Regent | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| Aurelion | Order, stars, time |
| Thalos | War, storms, strength |
| Myrr | Death, passage, memory |
| Serathiel | Knowledge, secrets |
| Vaelor | Nature, growth |
| Kaelis | Light, justice |
| Noxara | Darkness, dreams |
| Ioxara | Will, fate, freedom |

Ioxara was the youngest—and the most dangerous.

---

# 4. The Accord of Stars

The Regents bound themselves by an ancient contract:

> No Regent shall alter mortal destiny directly.

This agreement stabilized reality for over 8,000 years.

Magic flowed cleanly.
Empires rose peacefully.
Monsters were rare.

---

# 5. The Shattering of Ioxara

Ioxara concluded that the Accord was slavery disguised as protection.

She attempted to rewrite fate itself, granting mortals true autonomy.

The other Regents opposed her.

They could not kill her.

Instead, they shattered her essence across reality.

---

# 6. The Crownfall Cataclysm

When Ioxara broke:

- Ley lines ruptured
- Continents cracked
- Entire cities vanished
- New monsters formed
- The sky fractured

The Regents vanished soon after—dead, weakened, or hiding.

This event is known as **The Crownfall**.

---

# 7. The Willshards

Fragments of Ioxara became crystalline metaphysical artifacts called **Willshards**.

They embed into:

- Mountains
- Weapons
- Bloodlines
- Living minds

They grant:

- Reality manipulation
- Immense magical power
- Destiny alteration

They cost:

- Sanity
- Stability
- Fate itself

## Overview

The Commonwealth is the world’s largest nation by population, economy, and military power.

It formed by absorbing fractured kingdoms after the Crownfall, offering stability in exchange for sovereignty.

It is orderly.
Prosperous.
And deeply corrupt.
